---The canvas 2.0----

Classes must have Announcements, Assignments, Grades



--What we are working on--

*When you add an Assignment or announcement the professor must have like a time window of when the things appear and dissapear from student view.
*Make is so professors can also set time when making a new Assignemnt
	The system must give the professor a dropbox so set days. 

*Professor -> Manage Classes needs a complete rework.
*Give professors a list of their assignments and anncouncemts in their class
*Give professors the ability to hide and rewveal their assignments (with a checkbox)

--Bugs--

*Edit Course must send back to course list, it currently just stays in the same page
*Late assignments are not showing in the correct date.
